# Kubernetes Cluster Creation

We are in a middle of a huge paradigm shift, where technologies like containerization, docker, kubernetes 
are growing in popularity. Companies are adopting these technologies inorder to ensure that their services 
are highly available as well as feasible. This provides them an advantage over their competitors.

## What you can learn from this repo?

Here I have explained in brief the terminologies associated with kubernetes and the reason behind adopting K8S.
But, unless and until you try out something by yourself you are never gonna be confident about it. Keeping this
in mind, in order to get your hands dirty I have explained in details(in the best way possible here) on how to 
create your own K8S cluster.

## Details of the cluster that we are going to create

* It's a cluster with 1 master node and 2 worker nodes.
* All the nodes are linux based machines, I have used Ubuntu(You can choose any flavour of Linux).
