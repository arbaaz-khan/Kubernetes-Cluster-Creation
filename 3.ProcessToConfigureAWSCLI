Here we are going to configure AWS CLI on our local machine.
(The following instructions assume that you have a linux machine)

1. Run   sudo apt-get update
2. Run   sudo apt install awscli
3. Run   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID: <Enter your access KEY>
   AWS Secret Access Key: <Enter your Screte Access Key>
   Default region name: <Enter the zone in which you want to create your resources>
   Default output format: <Enter json/text, if left blank then json is assumed>
4. To test whether it's configured correctly
   Run   aws sts get-caller-identity
   It should output few details of the IAM user
5. Now our AWS CLI is configured.
