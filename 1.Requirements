We are going to install a single node Kubernetes Cluster.
We need the following:
1) Cloud platform: AWS(an account in AWS is required)
2) Tool to create the cluster: KOPs
3) Tool to access the cluster: Kubectl
4) Place to store the cluster state(KOPs needs it): S3 bucket

Don't worry about all of the above, just be patient and follow along.
